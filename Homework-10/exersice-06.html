			<div class="center-text">As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible where the div meets the .jpg background. I used the<br>
                same hexademical number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?<br><br><br><br>
                This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serious Float Drop when i resize<br>
                (reduce) the browser window. I think that is what "display;inline;/" stops IE doubling margin on float is for, but<br>
                would like further explanation to understand this comment.<br><br><br><br>
                Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be separate version wrappers as<br>
                we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is an example of an inner div as the<br>
                book suggests? I am still confused on that detail.<br><br><br><br>
                Even though i have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page stil huggs the left side? I've tried it in all of<br>
                them, but it won't budge?<br><br><br><br>
                Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own...It's in the wrapper., but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside.<br>
                However, when i remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</div>
